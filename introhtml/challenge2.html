    <h1>The Code Within</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Nobody's born smart.</strong> We all start at <strong>0</strong>. Can't talk, can't walk, certainly can't do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody's good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn't count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs</strong> just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are <em>born to learn</em>.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. <em>You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
        <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        <em>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.</em><br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a <em>little bit stronger</em>.<br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for <strong>growing.</strong> And you <em>keep going</em>.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It's not that you don't get it. <br>
        You just don't get it, <strong>yet.</strong><br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <strong>anyone, anywhere can understand</strong>.<br>
        <em>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</em><br>
    </p>
   
    <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
